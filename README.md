</p>
Dystribute is a package manager that connects to GitHub and platforms to get you the best version of your wanted package or program. Not for one but for all 

```
dyst import {git link}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Dystribute is still in an early phase of development and is currently very unstable </br>
> - Dystribute cannot get every package or program you think of
